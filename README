The vision of this project was to make a chess opening book that does not know how to play chess, and has no concept, inherently, of a board, pieces, legal moves, etc. This project was based on the transformer model as seen in the "Attention is all you need paper"

Note: In its current state, this model is undertrained because I trained it locally on my Mac, so the results are not as good as they can be. I will use a cloud hosted GPU in the future.
